#       description: "When May was a child, she was a lonely girl with a lazy eye and without any friends except a strange, homemade doll kept in a glass case given by her mother on her birthday. May becomes a lonely, weird young woman, working in an animal hospital and assisting the veterinarian in surgeries and sewing operated animals most of the time. Her lesbian colleague Polly has a sort of attraction for her. When the shy May meets the mechanic Adam Stubbs, she loves his hands and has a crush on him. They date, but the bizarre behavior of May one night pushes Adam away from her. Alone, May has a brief affair with Polly, but she feels rejected again when her colleague meets Ambrosia. When her doll is accidentally broken, the deranged May decides to build a friend for her, using the best parts her acquaintances can offer.",

    #     review: "I liked it. It was nice seeing a socially awkward young woman main character. The death scenes were pretty corny and took me out of immersion though. It seems like the directors were making the kill scenes kind of rediculous on purpose though. It was a sad movie. I'm rating it 4 stars instead of 3 because it is an unusual horror movie (premise etc)",
