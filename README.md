Welcome to Movie Manifest!

A site to rate and review all the movies you've seen; a great resource to look back on when recommending movies to friends and family!

I built this app with a Ruby on Rails/SQLite backend and a React frontend. You can create an account and access full CRUD functionality for both the Movie and Review models. This site boasts secure password protection, and A user can only edit and delete their own reviews. Try Movie Manifest out today! You can also view a video of the app's functionality below. Thanks for viewing!
